# AI_Health_Navigator
AI Health Navigator – an AI-powered symptom checker and triage assistant to relieve doctors, reduce waiting times, and make healthcare more efficient.
Final project for the Building AI course  

## Summary  
An AI-powered "Health Navigator" that assists patients with symptom assessment, triage, and pre-selection before a medical consultation.  
The goal is to reduce the workload of doctors, shorten waiting times, and use healthcare resources more efficiently.  
*(Building AI course project)*  

## Background  
The shortage of doctors is a growing global issue, leading to long waiting times, overburdened hospitals, and declining quality of care. Routine cases and minor illnesses often consume valuable time that should be reserved for urgent or complex conditions.  

My motivation: As a patient, relative, and mental coach, I see how urgently we need smart support systems to relieve both doctors and patients.  

**Problems this idea addresses:**  
- Long waiting times for appointments and diagnoses  
- Overcrowded emergency rooms  
- Inefficient use of doctors’ working hours  
- Lack of reliable tools for patients to assess their symptoms  

## Data sources and AI methods  
- **Data sources**: anonymized patient records, symptom databases (WHO, PubMed), medical guidelines  
- **AI methods**:  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for processing patient symptom descriptions  
  - Machine Learning classifiers to map symptoms to risk categories  
  - Decision-Support System for triage recommendations (e.g., “self-care,” “family doctor,” “emergency”)  

## How is it used?  
1. Patients use a mobile app or web platform to input their symptoms.  
2. The AI asks clarifying follow-up questions to refine the input.  
3. The system provides a recommendation: urgency level and suggested next step.  
4. Doctors receive structured, pre-qualified patient data, making consultations more efficient.  

**Users:**  
- **Patients**: quick guidance and less uncertainty  
- **Doctors**: relieved by structured pre-information  
- **Healthcare systems**: better allocation of limited resources  

## Challenges  
- AI cannot provide a final medical diagnosis – medical responsibility must remain with professionals.  
- Data privacy and security are critical.  
- Risk of underestimating or overestimating symptoms.  
- Acceptance by doctors and patients requires trust and transparency.  

## What next?  
- Integrate with telemedicine services.  
- Extend to chronic disease monitoring and follow-up care.  
- Collaborate with health insurers and clinics.  
- Long-term vision: create a standardized European triage system to mitigate the doctor shortage.  

## Acknowledgments  
- Inspired by telemedicine platforms (e.g., Ada Health, Babylon Health).  
- Built on open-source frameworks for NLP and machine learning.  
- Developed as part of the **Building AI course project**.
